		     To further understand the process of which we will go about this project we have to know what data we are aiming to collect, 
		     in our case we are looking at narratives that we can sample a bit from to base our research. Our goal is to understand the sex industry 
		     in a new way and learn from the people within it to understand what needs to be done. As I get through all of my source material I am 
		     aiming to collect as much qualitative data as possible to base our research on, the more information we have to go off of the more 
		     certain we can be about the results. I have quite a few sources that focus on the nordic model which I think is extremely useful as 
		     that is a model that many people in the sex industry outside of the countries using that model don’t want to adapt it so it is important 
		     to understand it to be able to grasp where sex workers want to move with a new model. I think it is important to understand my journey 
		     in terms of where I was originally planning on taking this project to where I have landed now. I initially wanted to focus on the 
		     legalization of prostitui=tion but have learned that that isn’t what sex workers want and I had a narrowed perspective of the 
		     sex work industry on top of that. I now have reframed my work to focusing on the decriminalization of sex work and getting people 
		     the rights they are fighting for.
