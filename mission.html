		The decriminalization of prostitution allows for sex workers to have the rights they need for a safe work environment. This
		would also allow them to reach out to law enforcement in risky situations without being scared of the people that are supposed 
		to be protecting them. We want our audience to understand the difference between legalization and decriminalization and why sex 
		workers are not in favor of legalization but rather the decriminalization of the sex industry. I also aim to inform my audience 
		about the nordic model and why many sex workers say that isn’t a viable option anymore and to explain why they are asking for a 
		different path to decriminalization. If I am able to show that sex workers are valid in their requests for decriminalization I would 
		hope that my research could be used for the bigger argument that might actually make a change for the better in these communities. If 
		my research doesn’t lead to my intended goal then I would love to work with other people interested in this case to see what else we need 
		to learn and where our next steps will take us in order to make sure the sex industry progresses rather than remaining stagnant. Our goal 
		is to assure that the sex industry is taken care of and allowed access to the same rights and services such as health care that other 
		industries have access to. Below I will link to the ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union, page on the decriminalization of the sex 
		industry in case you are interested in learning more about other people’s work.
