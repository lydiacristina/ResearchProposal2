		         I would like to begin with a disclaimer: since this research has not been done aside from skimming sources and watching a 
			 few videos here and there the “results” of this research project are not official or valid in any way, they are the 
			 author’s loose opinions based off of the information absorbed. If we got to the point in our research that leads us to 
			 the answer that decriminalization is best when it comes to moving forward to protect people in the sex work industry, 
			 I would hope this would be a good source in fighting for that movement and provide the support needed to this community. 
			 If the results yield that this is not the best option going forward I hope it helps people figure out what the best option 
			 would be in order to provide safer working conditions for the sex workers of the world. Proven or disproven I hope this 
			 research would still be the source of an open conversation to be had about the sex work industry and the people that make it, 
			 they deserve attention that isn’t based on how society views them and their life choices. If this project could do one 
			 thing I would hope that it would be able to open people’s eyes to this world, hopefully in a way one might not have 
			 considered prior to reading my research, changing one person’s view is a job well done at the end of the day because 
			 one shift set off a chain reaction down the line. Thanks for reading the bare bones of this research project, here’s 
			 to the industry this was all for.(:
