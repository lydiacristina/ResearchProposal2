	<H3>Introduction</H3>
		<p> The significance of the decriminalization of the sex work industry lies in the value of the lives of the people in that line of work
		that are working without rights and susceptible to injustice. Many of the people that turn to this line of work do it as a means
		to afford rent, food, debts, etc. All anybody wants to do is to be able to provide for themselves and their family and the way
		the sex work industry is treated makes it all that harder and dangerous for people to do just that. The criminalization of this
		industry leaves the workers at risk from police raids, maltreatment from those authority figures, violence from clients, and
		unsafe work environments which is something no one deserves. I plan on taking you through a journey through the nordic model 
		and the flaws it brings to the sex work industry as well as the direct asks of sex workers in the field on what they would like
		to see happen. Be prepared to learn about the impact society has on this group of people and what they go through on a daily basis. 
		Society has a very negative view of the sex working community and often disregards them. We will be exploring this through the narrative 
		lens, as looking at real-person recounts allows us to understand what is happening matter of act and not what society wants us to think 
		about this “degrading” industry. By looking at documentaries and TEDTalks we can get a better more true understanding of this world that 
		we are just being to uncover. </p>
